# Pigeon

A fictitious message delivery service called pigeon.

Our "pigeon" supports two main functions. Calling a mortar on a location, and delivering a UTF8 text message as binary.

Pigeon works by using gRPC to deliver messages from a client to a server. Really this is just a repository for me to play around with gRPC in .Net.

Originally forked from the gRPC samples folder.
